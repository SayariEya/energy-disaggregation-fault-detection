# energy-disaggregation-fault-detection
Detecting faults and malfunctions in electrical appliances using energy disaggregation techniques.

## Objective
This project focuses on detecting electrical appliance defects and malfunctions using disaggregated energy consumption data and LSTM-based anomaly detection models.

## Why It Matters
Identifying unusual consumption patterns helps reduce waste, optimize usage, and ensure safety in industrial settings.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, Numpy
- LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow)
- MongoDB (Data)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

## Methodology
- Energy data collected from smart meters
- Disaggregated by appliance or channel
- Cleaned, visualized, and fed into an LSTM model
- Anomalies detected using threshold-based dynamic scoring

## Results
The LSTM model identified unusual energy behaviors that aligned with potential faults in appliances or circuits.
